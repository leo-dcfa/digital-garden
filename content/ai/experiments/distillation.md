I keep reading about Chinese labs "attacking" frontier labs and performing "model distillation." Then very recently [Musk admitted xAI used distillation on OpenAI model's and admitted it was common practice](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/billionaires/musk-admits-distilling-openai-data-for-his-xai-heres-why-thats-controversial/).

How does one distill a model?

The idea is that you have

- A teacher model: large, well-trained, expensive to run
- A student model: smaller, faster, cheaper to deploy
- A task: classification, regression, whatever the teacher excels at

Instead of training the cheaper model directly, make the student approximate the teacher's output distribution as closely as possible, often on a subset of the training data.

There are different types of distillation:

1. Sequence-level
2. Token-level / logit KL
3. On-policy / GKD
4. Cross-tokenizer
